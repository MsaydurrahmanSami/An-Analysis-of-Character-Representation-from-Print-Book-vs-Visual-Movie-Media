# An-Analysis-of-Character-Representation-from-Print-Book-vs-Visual-Movie-Media

Our goal is Given an input video to select a  bunch of frames to create a summary video that can capture the vital information of the input video. With many books getting adapted as movies, video summarization provides a useful tool that assists video analysis. In this paper, we formulate a video movie summarization to determine the importance of any character in movies with their book counterparts. We propose a fully convolutional sequence network model classifier to solve the video summarization problem, a search model to analyze book representation and statistical analysis for comparison.
