# OurGoal

Our goal is Given an input video to select a  bunch of frames to create a summary video that can capture the vital information of the input video. With many books getting adapted as movies, video summarization provides a useful tool that assists video analysis. In this paper, we formulate a video movie summarization to determine the importance of any character in movies with their book counterparts. We propose a fully convolutional sequence network model classifier to solve the video summarization problem, a search model to analyze book representation and statistical analysis for comparison.

Review-
1.Screen time of an actor in a movie or an episode is very important. Many actors get paid according to their total screen time. Moreover, we also want to know how much time our favorite character acted on screen.With the advancement of deep learning now its possible to solve various difficult problems.To solve any problem with deep learning, the first requirement is the data.
