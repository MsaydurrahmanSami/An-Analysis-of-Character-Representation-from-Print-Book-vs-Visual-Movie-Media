# OurGoal

Our goal is Given an input video to select a  bunch of frames to create a summary video that can capture the vital information of the input video. With many books getting adapted as movies, video summarization provides a useful tool that assists video analysis. In this paper, we formulate a video movie summarization to determine the importance of any character in movies with their book counterparts. We propose a fully convolutional sequence network model classifier to solve the video summarization problem, a search model to analyze book representation and statistical analysis for comparison.

Review-

1.Screen time of an actor in a movie or an episode is very important. Many actors get paid according to their total screen time. Moreover, we also want to know how much time our favorite character acted on screen.With the advancement of deep learning now its possible to solve various difficult problems.To solve any problem with deep learning, the first requirement is the data.[https://theailearner.com/2019/03/24/calculating-screen-time-of-an-actor-using-deep-learning/]

2.More than 80% of internet traffic will be real data except in particular, it could be video data[3]. It gives us a certain intuitive sense of how much video data there and how many tools to manage the massive amount of video data. Video recorded in one day could have 5 minutes of video summarization instead of 24 hours video. We can use video summarization for thumbnail generation, if we put a mouse around the video on youtube, we will see that the thumbnail option for the summary of the video, which includes the main video is for. A fair bit of the summarization system can automatically generate those thumbnails. In video Customization, if we put a different video on social media on another platform, they show they have a limitation on how long that video can be. Somehow we need to adjust those accordingly. We can use Video Summarization for a better summary In highlight creation compare it with our text analyzer Before we watch any movie based on our favorite book.[https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/papers/Mrigank_Rochan_Video_Summarization_Using_ECCV_2018_paper.pdf]
